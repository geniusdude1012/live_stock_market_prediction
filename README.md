# Live Stock Market Prediction

This project predicts live stock market trends using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. It leverages historical stock data and real-time inputs to forecast future price movements and assist in decision-making.

## Project Overview

The stock market is highly dynamic and influenced by multiple factors. In this project, we:
Collected and processed stock price data.
Applied time series analysis and machine learning models.
Used LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) for sequence prediction.
Built visualizations to understand trends and model performance.

## Features
<ul>
  <li>Fetches live stock data using APIs (yFinance / Alpha Vantage).</li>
  <li>Preprocesses and normalizes stock price data.</li>
  <li>Predicts closing prices and trends using ML/DL models.</li>
  <li>Visualizes predictions vs actual prices with interactive graphs.</li>
</ul>
